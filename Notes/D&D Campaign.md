## Plot Points
    Start at tavern in non military, remote village
    Golems role in and occupy town
    Golems rough up townsfolk and possibly Players if they get too close or engage with them
    (Golems are controlled by a rogue Artificer that wants a rare material that exists below that village)
    Townsfolk ask Players to stop the golems by finding the person controlling the golems and stopping them or get a message to their country's military
    To stop the Artificer, they can either follow a messenger golem, ask the townsfolk where the golems came from, follow the golem tracks, or choose a direction(if no one can figure out how to find where to go)
    Whatever path they choose to take, they will come across goblins due to golems trying to clear out their homes (the Players can also go to the goblin homes to kill the golem(s) with or without goblin help)
    Single golem encounter with chance for another golem
